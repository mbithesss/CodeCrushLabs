                    <p>
                        These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of Drink Aladdin's
                        Mobile Application, located at https://drinkaladdin.com.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                        automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                        that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                        allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                        our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                        to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
                        versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                        database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
                        to it, still belong to Drink Aladdin Distributors.

                    <p>
                        Drink Aladdin Distributors is committed to ensuring that the app is
                        as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                        its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                        charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Drink Aladdin app stores and processes personal data that
                        you have provided to us, to provide our
                        Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                        official operating system of your device. It could make your
                        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                        compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                        that the Drink Aladdin app won’t work properly or at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app does use third-party services that declare their
                        Terms and Conditions.

                    <p>
                        You should be aware that there are certain things that
                        Drink Aladdin Distributors will not take responsibility for.
                        Certain functions of the app will require the app to have
                        an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi,
                        or provided by your mobile network provider, but Drink Aladdin
                        Distributors cannot take responsibility for the app not
                        working at full functionality if you don’t have access to
                        Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                        should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                        may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                        for the duration of the connection while accessing the app,
                        or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re
                        accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                        roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
                        territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
                        roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                        which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
                        that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                        using the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along the same lines, Drink Aladdin Distributors cannot
                        always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.
                        You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if
                        it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail
                        the Service, Drink Aladdin Distributors cannot accept
                        responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to Drink Aladdin Distributors’s responsibility
                        for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
                        important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                        ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                        rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                        we can make it available to you. Drink Aladdin Distributors
                        accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
                        experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality
                        of the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                        currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for
                        both systems(and for any additional systems we
                        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                        using the app. Drink Aladdin Distributors does not promise
                        that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to
                        you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have
                        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                        from your device.
